# spreadsheet-benchmark
Spreadsheet systems are used for storing and analyzing data
across domains by programmers and non-programmers alike.
While spreadsheet systems have continued to support
increasingly large datasets,
they are prone to hanging and
freezing while performing computations even on much smaller ones.
We have developed this benchmark
to evaluate and compare the performance of a spreadsheet system.
The benchmark a) measures the scalability of a spreadsheet systems
and b) investigates how a spreadsheet system stores data and whether it adopts optimizations
to speed up computation.
In our current release, we evaluate three popular systems, Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, and Google Sheets,
on a range of canonical spreadsheet computation operations.
